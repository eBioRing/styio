# Workflow Orchestration

**Purpose:** Define the registered workflow documents, tool responsibilities, ordering rules, and scheduler entrypoints that keep Styio delivery workflows separated and executable.

**Last updated:** 2026-05-02

## Separation Rules

1. Every active `docs/assets/workflow/*.md` file, except `README.md` and generated `INDEX.md`, must be registered in `scripts/workflow-scheduler.py`.
2. Each workflow document owns exactly one responsibility boundary. A new workflow must not restate another workflow's gate details; it links to the owner instead.
3. Each tool owns exactly one validation responsibility. Profiles may reuse a tool, but two tools must not check the same responsibility.
4. Profiles must run tools in ascending phase order. Earlier phases may prepare evidence; later phases must not redefine earlier checks.
5. A delivery workflow is not complete until the scheduler registry, workflow docs, CI entrypoint, and delivery entrypoint agree.

## Profiles

| Profile | Scope | Ordered Call Chain |
|---------|-------|--------------------|
| `syntax-local` | Local syntax-change worktree verification. | scheduler check -> scheduler tests -> tracked hygiene -> runtime surface -> team docs -> docs audit -> ecosystem CLI docs |
| `delivery-checkpoint` | Worktree process gates before checkpoint health. | worktree hygiene -> runtime surface -> worktree team docs -> docs audit -> ecosystem CLI docs |
| `delivery-staged` | Staged-index process gates for commit hooks and staged handoff. | staged hygiene -> runtime surface -> staged team docs -> docs audit -> ecosystem CLI docs |
| `delivery-push` | Branch handoff against a base ref. | push hygiene -> runtime surface -> base team docs -> docs audit -> ecosystem CLI docs |
| `ci-prebuild` | GitHub Actions prebuild checks before compile/test. | scheduler check -> scheduler tests -> tracked hygiene -> incoming history hygiene -> runtime surface -> base team docs -> workspace ecosystem CLI docs |

## Required Commands

Validate registry and ordering:

```bash
python3 scripts/workflow-scheduler.py check
```

Run local syntax workflow checks:

```bash
python3 scripts/workflow-scheduler.py run --profile syntax-local
```

Run branch delivery checks:

```bash
python3 scripts/workflow-scheduler.py run --profile delivery-push --base origin/main --range origin/main..HEAD
```

## Adding A Workflow

1. Search `docs/assets/workflow/` and this registry before creating a new workflow.
2. If no existing workflow owns the responsibility, add the new document and register it in `WORKFLOW_DOCS`.
3. Add or reuse tools in `TOOLS`, preserving one responsibility per tool.
4. Add the tool to a profile only where the profile's scope requires it.
5. Run `python3 scripts/workflow-scheduler.py check`, `python3 tests/workflow_scheduler_test.py`, and `python3 scripts/docs-index.py --write`.
