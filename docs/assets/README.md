# Docs Assets

**Purpose:** Define the scope of reusable documentation assets under `docs/assets/`; the generated inventory lives in [INDEX.md](./INDEX.md).

**Last updated:** 2026-04-08

## Scope

1. `docs/assets/workflow/` mirrors reusable process and verification documents now surfaced at root `workflows/`.
2. `docs/assets/templates/` stores reusable document skeletons.
3. Do not store date-specific implementation history in this subtree.

## Usage Rules

1. If a workflow or template can be reused across checkpoints, keep it here.
2. If the content is tied to one day or one refactor slice, keep it in history or ADR instead.
3. Update the relevant asset and its consumers together when workflow rules change.

## Inventory

See [INDEX.md](./INDEX.md).
