# CLI / Nano Runbook

**Purpose:** Provide the daily-work entrypoint for maintainers of the `styio` CLI, diagnostics surface, `styio-nano` profile pruning, and nano package bootstrap contracts.

**Last updated:** 2026-05-09

## Mission

Own user-facing command execution, the bootstrap packaging path for `styio-nano`, and the compiler-side handoff contracts consumed by `styio-spio`. This team protects CLI options, error formatting, exit codes, machine-info capabilities, source-build metadata, nano profile compile definitions, and the static nano package contract. It does not own long-term package-manager UX, which belongs to `styio-spio`.

## Owned Surface

Primary paths:

1. `src/main.cpp`
2. `src/StyioConfig/`
3. `configs/`
4. `scripts/gen-styio-nano-profile.py`
5. `scripts/source-build-minimal.sh`
6. Nano package tests in `tests/styio_test.cpp`

Key implementation seams inside `src/StyioConfig/`:

1. `CompilePlanContract.*` owns compile-plan version/build-mode parsing and validation shared by full `styio` execution paths.
2. `SourceBuildInfo.*` owns the published `--source-build-info=json` payload and its mapping to the official `spio build` source-layout contract.

Key handoff document:

1. [../external/for-spio/Styio-Nano-Spio-Coordination.md](../external/for-spio/Styio-Nano-Spio-Coordination.md)

## Daily Workflow

1. Determine whether the change affects full `styio`, `styio-nano`, or both.
2. Keep CLI option changes discoverable through help text and tests.
3. Keep `--machine-info` capability output aligned with actual behavior.
4. Keep `--source-build-info=json` aligned with the official source-layout contract consumed by `spio build`.
5. Treat nano static repository layout as a contract; update handoff docs when it changes.
6. Keep package-manager responsibilities out of the compiler unless they are bootstrap validation or official source-build layout export.
7. When compile-plan, source-build-info, or diagnostics behavior changes, keep the `styio-spio` / `styio-view` coordinator mirror and handoff docs aligned in the same checkpoint.
8. When runtime event artifacts change, keep `supported_contracts.runtime_events`, `feature_flags.runtime_event_stream`, `receipt.json`, and `build_root/runtime-events.jsonl` aligned in the same checkpoint.
9. Keep generated nano subset build manifests aligned with the repository compatibility floor and the shared `styio-nightly` / `styio-spio` toolchain baseline when `src/main.cpp` emits CMake scaffolding.
10. Keep `scripts/source-build-minimal.sh` aligned with the published `--source-build-info=json` contract so build-channel consumers have one stable compiler-side helper entry.
11. Prefer named enum tables and shared field-resolution helpers for project config, nano package config, nano publish config, and nano manifest parsing so new keys or aliases are added in one place instead of another `if/else` ladder in `src/main.cpp`.
12. Treat config alias changes as contract changes when they affect source-build, nano packaging, or publish bootstrap behavior; update this runbook and the handoff docs in the same checkpoint.
13. Keep compile-plan contract parsing and source-build metadata export in `src/StyioConfig/` as the single source of truth; `src/main.cpp` may orchestrate those paths, but it should not grow a second parser or duplicate build-mode vocabulary.
14. When frontend, StyioIR optimizer, or runtime source roots gain new support libraries, update the local-subset nano closure seed list, generated CMake include paths, generated config headers, and link libraries together; `StyioNanoPackage.LocalSubset*` tests must prove the extracted clean-room bundle still links.
15. When compiler source-layout directories move, update `SourceBuildInfo.*`, `styio_nano_source_roots_latest(...)`, and the `StyioDiagnostics.SourceBuildInfoJsonReportsOfficialSourceLayoutFields` regression together so `spio build` consumers see the same controlled component graph as local nano bundles.
16. When internal prelude source files such as `src/StyioPrelude/resources.styio` become part of compiler behavior, include them in `--source-build-info=json` controlled components and the matching diagnostics regression.
17. When `--profile-frontend` grows runtime-side records, keep the CLI flush hook in `src/main.cpp` paired with a profiler smoke that proves the emitted JSON includes the new section. Native executable profiling stays opt-in through `STYIO_NATIVE_PROFILE_OUT` so benchmark validation can collect run-only attribution without adding overhead to measured repeats.
18. Keep `--nano-create` clean-room local-subset builds on the same Clang CMake compiler pair used to build Styio unless `CC` or `CXX` is explicitly set by the caller; generated `build-styio-nano.sh` must preserve that override rule.
19. When Sema / IR gains a new required implementation directory such as `src/StyioResourceTopology/`, add its `.cpp` seed to `styio_nano_source_roots_latest(...)` so local-subset nano packages link in a clean-room bundle.
20. Keep `styio build <file_path> -o <artifact_name>` aligned with the native executable artifact contract: it must not execute the entry program during build, must reuse the compile-plan `intent=build` frontend path, and must link the Styio runtime helper surface into the produced executable.
21. Remove unused CLI debug helpers instead of leaving ad hoc public symbols or stdout probes in `src/main.cpp`; command-visible diagnostics should go through the existing CLI error and option paths.
22. Keep clean-room nano package builds resource-bounded by default. `STYIO_NANO_BUILD_JOBS` may raise the build parallelism on larger machines, but generated helpers should not default to unbounded `--parallel`.
23. Keep the Spio handoff doc pointed at current contracts only. Do not reintroduce deleted bootstrap/source-build long plans after their durable rules have moved into this runbook, the repository map, or the handoff document.

## Change Classes

1. Small: help text, config parsing cleanup, or non-contract local path fix. Run targeted CLI or nano tests.
2. Medium: CLI option, diagnostic format, exit code, nano profile, machine-info capability, or runtime event artifact change. Update tests and docs.
3. High: nano package layout, publish/consume validation, compiler/package-manager responsibility split, or config parser alias/table changes that affect bootstrap contracts. Use checkpoint workflow and review the `styio-spio` handoff.

## Required Gates

Minimum local commands:

```bash
ctest --test-dir build/default -R '^StyioDiagnostics\.'
ctest --test-dir build/default -R 'Nano|nano'
ctest --test-dir build/default -L milestone
```

When package behavior changes:

```bash
cmake --build build/default --target styio styio_nano
ctest --test-dir build/default -L styio_pipeline
python3 scripts/ecosystem-cli-doc-gate.py
python3 scripts/docs-audit.py
```

## Cross-Team Dependencies

1. Codegen / Runtime must review runtime capability, extern, or execution behavior surfaced through CLI.
2. Test Quality must review new CLI/nano tests and package workflow regression coverage.
3. Docs / Ecosystem must review [../external/for-spio/Styio-Nano-Spio-Coordination.md](../external/for-spio/Styio-Nano-Spio-Coordination.md) changes.
4. Frontend or Sema / IR must review CLI switches that select parser or compiler-stage behavior.

## Handoff / Recovery

Record unfinished CLI/nano work with:

1. Option or config key touched.
2. Full vs nano behavior difference.
3. Package layout or registry contract delta.
4. Exact create/publish/consume command used.
5. Whether `styio-spio` is expected to take over the responsibility later.
