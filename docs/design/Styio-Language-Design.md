**Status:** Active Design — Pre-stabilization

## 1. Introduction

Styio is an **intent-aware, symbol-driven stream processing language** designed for high-performance resource dispatching, with an initial target domain of **financial quantitative analysis**. It compiles through LLVM to native code, achieving C++-level performance with a fraction of the syntactic overhead.

The name encodes the language's identity:
- **St** — Stream Computing
- **y** — Style / Syntax
- **io** — Native I/O primitives

### 1.1 Design Pillars

| Pillar | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Pure Symbolism** | Replace natural-language keywords (`if`, `while`, `for`, `def`) with unambiguous symbolic operators (`?=`, `>>`, `#`, `@`). |
| **Intent Awareness** | The compiler statically analyzes field access patterns and pushes intent down to resource drivers (e.g., only fetch needed database columns). |
| **Honest Missing** | Runtime absence is represented as `@` in diagnostics and stream algebra. Source-level bare `@` is retired from active syntax; current code should obtain absence from resources or intrinsics instead of authoring it directly. |
| **Thick Library, Thin Artifact** | Development uses a rich standard library with protocol detection and AI-assisted probing. Production builds perform dead-code elimination to produce minimal binaries. |

### 1.2 Compiler Toolchain

- **Language:** C++20
- **Backend:** LLVM 18+ (IRBuilder + ORC JIT)
- **Parser Strategy:** Hand-written recursive descent, LL(n) with lookahead
- **Dependencies:** LLVM, ICU，及测试用 GoogleTest、cxxopts 等 — **完整清单与许可** 见 [`../specs/THIRD-PARTY.md`](../specs/THIRD-PARTY.md)。

---

## 2. Core Philosophy

### 2.1 Everything Is a Flow

Styio has no explicit loop constructs (`for`, `while`). Instead, data sources emit **pulses** into **closures** via the pipe operator `>>`. The closure executes once per pulse. Loops emerge naturally from infinite or finite data generators.

### 2.2 Progressive Performance

The language follows a "write less, get convenience; write more, get speed" model:
- Omit type annotations → compiler infers defaults (`i32` for integers, `f64` for floats)
- Add explicit types → compiler generates optimized, specialized instructions
- Omit resource protocol → runtime probes automatically
- Specify protocol (e.g., `@file`, `@mysql`) → zero-overhead static dispatch

### 2.3 Expression-Oriented

All control flow constructs (match, conditional wave, loops) are **expressions** that produce values. There are no void statements — everything flows.

---

## 3. Type System

### 3.1 Primitive Types

| Type | Bits | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `bool` | 1 | Boolean |
| `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `i128` | 8–128 | Signed integers |
| `f32`, `f64` | 32, 64 | IEEE 754 floating point |
| `char` | variable | Unicode character |
| `string` / `str` | variable | UTF-8 string |
| `byte` | 8 | Raw byte |

### 3.2 Default Types

When type annotations are omitted:
- Integer literals default to `i32`, including negative literals such as `-1`
- Floating-point literals default to `f64`, including negative literals such as `-1.5`

### 3.3 Type Annotations

Types are annotated with `:` on both parameters and return values:

```
# add : f32 = (a: f32, b: f32) => a + b
```

- `add : f32` — return type is `f32`
- `a: f32` — parameter type
- `:` always binds a **type** to its left-hand identifier
- `m: matrix = [[1,0],[0,1]]` — explicit matrix context accepts a nested list source form, checks that all rows are non-empty, rectangular, and numeric, and lowers the value to a matrix handle; untyped nested lists remain ordinary lists

### 3.4 Matrix Values

`matrix` is a typed numeric collection, not a universal nested-list mode. The parser keeps
`[[...], [...]]` as an ordinary list literal unless the surrounding type context explicitly says
`matrix`; this avoids paying rectangular-shape checks for every nested list expression.

```styio
m: matrix = [[1,0],[0,1]]
```

Matrix binding rules:

- rows must be non-empty and rectangular
- elements must be numeric, with mixed integer/float values promoted to `f64`
- statically known dimensions are preserved in the inferred type
- shape mismatches are semantic errors before lowering
- `m[row][col]` reads one element, while `m[row]` materializes a list row

Matrix operators and functions:

| Surface | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `a + b`, `a - b` | element-wise matrix add/subtract; shapes must match |
| `a * b` | matrix multiply when both operands are matrices |
| `a * scalar`, `scalar * a` | scalar multiplication |
| `mat_add`, `mat_sub`, `mat_hadamard`, `matmul` | explicit matrix arithmetic helpers |
| `transpose`, `dot`, `norm`, `mat_sum` | common numeric reductions/transforms |
| `mat_zeros`, `mat_zeros_i64`, `mat_identity`, `mat_identity_i64` | constructors |
| `mat_shape`, `mat_rows`, `mat_cols`, `mat_get`, `mat_set`, `mat_clone` | shape, access, mutation, and copy helpers |

The current runtime representation is a flat row-major matrix handle with element-kind-specific
helpers for `i64` and `f64`. Small statically shaped same-type operations may lower directly to
LLVM loads/stores over the flat backing store; dynamic, mixed-kind, or larger operations route
through the runtime helper surface registered in ORC.

### 3.5 Runtime Absence: `@`

`@` represents **honest absence** at runtime and in diagnostics. It is not `null`, not `0`, not `NaN` — it is the explicit admission that data does not exist.

**2026-04-24 syntax revision:** user-authored bare `@` is no longer part of the
active source language. Historical fixtures such as `x = @`, `x + @`,
`x -> @stdout`, and the old wave-dispatch sink shorthand were retired from active milestones.
`@` remains visible as an absence marker produced by resources/intrinsics and in
diagnostics.

**Propagation rules:**
- absence produced by resource/intrinsic execution propagates through supported
  arithmetic and logical operators
- absence short-circuits through expressions until explicitly intercepted

**Diagnostic tainting (debug mode):**
In debug builds, `@` carries metadata (reason code, source location) enabling root-cause tracing via `.reason()`.

---

## 4. Module Imports

Styio uses explicit top-level imports to declare module dependencies across `.styio` files.

### 4.1 Import Declaration

```text
@import { styio/mod, styio.mod; core }
```

Rules:

- `@import` is only valid at file top level.
- `/` is the native package and module path separator.
- `.` is accepted as a compatibility spelling and is normalized to slash form internally.
- A single import item must not mix `.` and `/`.
- `,` and `;` are equivalent separators between import items.
- Empty import lists, trailing separators, and the legacy leading string-list form such as `["pkg"]` are syntax errors.

### 4.2 Resolution Semantics

Each import item creates one explicit import fact for the current file. The IDE and HIR layers expose these facts in canonical slash form, so `styio.mod` and `styio/mod` both resolve as `styio/mod` internally.

Import resolution remains explicit:

- bare package paths are resolved through the project-aware import lookup rules
- `.styio` is tried when the import candidate does not already name a Styio file
- unresolved imports stay unresolved instead of binding to unrelated same-text symbols elsewhere in the workspace

---

## 5. Functions

### 5.1 Definition Syntax

Functions are declared with `#`:

```
# add := (a, b) => { <| a + b }    // block form with explicit yield
# add := (a, b) => a + b            // expression form (implicit yield)
# add := (a: i32, b: i32) => a + b  // with type annotations
# add : i32 = (a: i32, b: i32) => a + b  // with return type
```

### 5.2 Anonymous Closures

Used within stream pipes:

```
prices >> #(p) => { <| p * 2 }
```

`#(p)` binds the current pulse to the local name `p`.

### 5.3 Context Capture with `$(...)`

Functions can explicitly capture external variables by reference:

```
trade $(bal, is_open) := my_strategy <| bal <| is_open
```

The `$(...)` list declares a **reactive binding** — the function re-evaluates whenever captured variables change.

---

## 6. Control Flow

Styio's control flow is entirely **symbol-driven** and **expression-oriented**.

### 6.1 Pattern Matching: `?=`

```
x ?= {
    1  => { <| "one" }
    2  => { <| "two" }
    _  => { <| "other" }
}
```

- `?=` — match operator (condition probe)
- `=>` — pattern-to-result mapping
- `_` or an all-underscore identifier such as `_______` — wildcard / default branch
- `<|` — yield (explicit return from block)

The binding form matches a scrutinee while exposing it to every arm:

```
#(n = values.length) ?= {
    0 => { /* empty */ }
    1 => { answer = values[0] }
    _ => { /* n is available here */ }
}
```

For integer match lowering, literal arms (`1 => ...`) and guarded equality arms
that compare the scrutinee to an integer (`(n == 1) => ...`) are semantically
the same arm. AST lowering emits ordinary StyioIR, then the StyioIR optimizer
canonicalizes equivalent match shapes before LLVM codegen so accepted source
spellings can produce identical switch-shaped LLVM IR.

### 6.2 Infinite Loop

```
[...] => { /* body */ }
```

`[...]` is an infinite pulse generator. The closure executes indefinitely.

### 6.3 Conditional Loop (While-equivalent)

```
[...] >> ?(expr) => { /* body */ }
```

- `[...]` — infinite generator
- `>>` — pipe the generator into the workflow
- `?(expr) =>` — guard / valve: only passes pulses into the body when `expr` is truthy

### 6.4 Collection Iteration (For-each-equivalent)

```
[1, 2, 3] >> #(item) => { /* body */ }
```

The collection becomes a finite pulse source. Each element is bound to `item`.

### 6.5 Break: `^...` (Immediate Loop)

```
^       // break out of the nearest enclosing loop
^^      // same as ^
^^^^    // same as ^
```

Rules:
- `^` characters must be **contiguous** (no spaces)
- any contiguous run of `^` is one break statement
- the count of `^` characters has no semantic depth and is normalized to 1
- `^^ ^^` is **illegal** — it is two adjacent break statements, not a deeper break
- a break outside an enclosing loop is rejected by code generation

### 6.6 Continue: `>>` (Variable Length, ≥2)

```
>>      // skip current iteration (1 level)
>>>     // skip 2 levels
>>>>    // skip 3 levels
```

The base continue is 2 characters (`>>`). Each additional `>` skips one more nesting level. Context distinguishes continue from pipe: continue appears as a **standalone statement** (not connecting source to consumer).

### 6.7 Yield / Return: `<|`

```
# square := (x) => { <| x * x }
```

`<|` pushes a value out of the current block. When used in control flow that is part of an assignment, it produces the value for the enclosing expression.

In expression position, `<|` applies one value to a callable/continuation. Chained
apply-pipe examples are not canonical while continuation lowering remains pending.

Captured continuations follow the OCaml-style one-shot discipline: a suspended continuation must be resumed or discontinued exactly once. Resuming it consumes it; resuming it again is an error. While suspended, it keeps captured scope data and resources alive until resume/discontinue unwinds the frame.

For compressed one-line blocks, `|<| value |;` is the inline return spelling. `|>` and `|<-` remain reserved.

When multiple branches yield (e.g., in `?=`), the compiler generates LLVM `phi` nodes at the merge point.

### 6.8 Tasks and Await: `||>` / `?|`

`||> { ... }` constructs one scheduled task. `||> [ name := { ... } ... ]`
launches a group of independent task blocks and binds each name to its task handle.

```styio
||> [
    price := { <| fetch_price() }
    risk  := { <| calc_risk() }
]

?| price -> p: f64
?| risk -> r: f64 | 0.0
```

`?| task -> value: T` awaits or pulls a task/future handle and declares `value`
with type `T`. `?| task -> value: T | fallback` evaluates `fallback` only when
the task pull reports runtime failure or absence. The fallback separator is the
ordinary `|`; `??` remains diagnostic extraction, not async fallback syntax.

`?| -> value: T` is reserved as the bare "freeze here" continuation point. The
parser accepts the shape, but semantic analysis currently fails closed until
first-class continuation lowering can guarantee one-shot resume/discontinue.

---

## 7. Guard Conditionals

Guard conditionals replace ternary expressions and if/else chains with a single
condition-first spelling. The old wave spellings are tokenized but reserved:
`<~` and `~>` have no active user-level semantics.

### 7.1 Inline Guard Value: `?(cond) => A | B`

```
val = ?(a > b) => a | b
```

Read as: "If condition holds, evaluate to `a`; otherwise evaluate to `b`." This is the canonical inline value-selection form.

### 7.2 Block Guard: `?(cond) =>`

```
?(signal) => {
    order_logic(p)
} | {
    fallback_logic(p)
}
```

Read as: "If signal is truthy, execute the block; otherwise execute the fallback block." When the fallback block is omitted, the false branch routes to `@` (void).

### 7.3 Visual Semantics

| Form | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `?(cond) => A \| B` | Inline value selection |
| `?(cond) => { A } \| { B }` | Block-level if/else |
| `\|` | Else/fallback separator |

---

## 8. Resource System

### 8.1 Resource Identifiers: `@`

Resources are accessed via the `@` prefix:

```
@("localhost:8080")          // auto-detect protocol
@file("readme.txt")          // explicit file protocol
@mysql("localhost:3306")     // explicit MySQL protocol
@binance("BTCUSDT")         // exchange data feed
```

**Protocol resolution:**
- `@{...}` or `@(...)` without prefix → runtime probes via plugin dictionary
- `@protocol(...)` with prefix → compile-time static dispatch (zero overhead)

### 8.2 Handle Acquisition: `<-`

```
f <- @file("readme.txt")
```

`<-` extracts a live handle (file descriptor, socket, cursor) from a resource.

### 8.3 Reading: `>>`

```
f >> #(chunk: [byte; 4096]) => { buf += chunk }
```

### 8.4 Writing: `<<`

```
"Hello Styio" << f
```

### 8.5 Lifecycle: Scope-based RAII

Resources are automatically released when their enclosing scope ends. The compiler inserts cleanup code at every exit path (including `^^` breaks and `<|` returns).

### 8.6 Persistence via Redirection: `->`

```
ma5 -> @database("redis://localhost/ma5_cache")
```

`->` redirects a value's storage destination. The runtime asynchronously syncs to the target resource.

### 8.7 Standard Stream Resources

Styio models the three Unix standard streams as **compiler-recognized resource atoms** over a
single built-in terminal handle, canonically written `[>_]`. The parenthesized terminal device
`(>_)` remains a compatibility spelling for parser/runtime surfaces that already use it.

The current frozen grammar accepts:

```
@stdout
@stderr
@stdin
```

directly in source code. Users do not need to repeat the internal prelude declarations before
using these standard streams. The declarations still exist as Styio source in the resource prelude
rather than as a C++ resource-name registry.

**`>_` — The Terminal Device**

`>_` is the first-class terminal device value. In symbolic standard-stream definitions, the
bracketed terminal-handle spelling `[>_]` is canonical:

| Operation | Canonical symbolic form | Compatibility form | Unix fd | Semantics |
|-----------|--------------------------|--------------------|---------|-----------|
| Scalar write | `x -> [>_]` | `x -> (>_)` | fd 1 | Write one scalar/text value to stdout |
| Iterable write | `xs >> [>_]` | `xs >> (>_)` | fd 1 | Serialize an iterable value to stdout |
| Scalar error write | `!(x) -> [>_]` | `!(x) -> (>_)` | fd 2 | Write one scalar/text value to stderr (unbuffered) |
| Iterable error write | `!(xs) >> [>_]` | `!(xs) >> (>_)` | fd 2 | Serialize an iterable value to stderr (unbuffered) |
| Read stream shorthand | `<\|[>_]` | `<\|(>_)` | fd 0 | Return the terminal input stream |
| Read stream expanded | `<\| <- [>_]` | `<\| <- (>_)` | fd 0 | Pull the terminal input stream, then return it |

`!()` acts as a **channel selector**: without `!`, data goes to fd 1 (stdout); with `!`,
data goes to fd 2 (stderr). The compiler disambiguates from logical NOT by context:
`!(expr) -> ( >_ )` is always channel-select.

`expr -> [>_]` and `expr -> @stdout` are scalar/text redirects to stdout. `items >> [>_]`
and `items >> @stdout` are narrower: the left side
must be an iterable value whose items can be serialized to text, such as `list[T]`, `dict[string,T]`,
or an explicitly produced line list. Plain `string >> [>_]` and `string >> @stdout` are rejected so the compiler never has
to guess between character iteration and newline splitting. Use `string -> [>_]` for scalar text,
or `string.lines() >> [>_]` / `string.lines() >> @stdout` when newline splitting is intended.

**@stdout** — write-only, system-default buffering (line-buffered for TTY, block-buffered for pipes).

**@stderr** — write-only, **unbuffered** (immediate `fflush(stderr)` after each write).

**@stdin** — read-only, iterable stream. The canonical internal declarations are:

```styio
@ stdin := #() => { <|[>_] }
@ stdin := #() => { <|(>_) }
@ stdin := #() => { <| <- [>_] }
@ stdin := #() => { <| <- (>_) }  // compatibility terminal-device spelling
```

`<|(>_)` is a call-like shorthand: `<|` supplies the exported value and `(>_)` is the
terminal-device argument. `[>_]` replaces the earlier `| >_ |` spelling to avoid a `|>`
visual/tokenization ambiguity. `@stdin >> #(line) => {...}` iterates lines.
EOF terminates iteration naturally. New design text should not use `<<` for stdin reads or
`lines << @stdin` for implicit collection; collect explicitly inside the iterator body or through
a named typed-read API. Older frozen docs and implementations accepted `(<< @stdin)` as instant
pull; treat that as a compatibility artifact, not the canonical read/pull spelling.

**Write syntax:**

```
42 -> @stdout              // redirect value to stdout (action)
"Hello" -> @stdout         // redirect string to stdout
@stdout("Hello")           // call form (freezes for continuation)
```

Frozen milestone docs use `-> @stdout` / `-> @stderr` as the **canonical spelling**.
The current compiler also accepts iterable stream-sink writes:

```
values >> @stdout
text.lines() >> @stdout
warnings >> @stderr
```

When `>>` is followed by a standard-stream resource atom (`@stdout` / `@stderr`), the parser
builds a `resource_write` node. The semantic rule matches terminal-handle `>> [>_]`: the left
side must be iterable and text-serializable. Use `->` for scalar values and `>>` only where
stream-sink style is intentional.

**Direction constraints:**

- `@stdin` is read-only: `expr -> @stdin` and `expr >> @stdin` are semantic errors
- `@stdout` / `@stderr` are write-only: `@stdout >> #(x) => {...}` is a semantic error
- Standard streams need no repeated user-authored declarations; `f <- @stdout` is a semantic error

**Compiler recognition:** The compiler recognizes `@stdout`, `@stderr`, `@stdin` directly at
parse/lowering time and emits direct FFI-backed standard-stream IR (`printf`/`puts` for
stdout, `fprintf(stderr, ...)` for stderr, `fgets(stdin)` for stdin). Scalar `expr -> @stdout`
and iterable `items >> @stdout` both lower through the standard-stream write IR family, with
the `>>` route requiring text-serializable iterable input before lowering.

---

## 9. State Management

### 9.1 The Problem

Stream processing requires **memory across pulses**. A simple local variable resets every frame. Styio solves this with explicit state containers.

### 9.2 Resource Object State

Topology v2 treats named state as a resource object:

```styio
@price : f64|..10| := { ... }
```

Bare `@price` is the resource object itself. It is not the latest scalar value.

```styio
latest = @price[-1]
prev   = @price[-2]
recent = @price[-3..]
all    = @price[...]
```

`T|n|` means exact length; `T|..n|` means a recent-window resource that keeps the latest `n` values. Unbounded repetition is written with a type suffix:

```styio
i64|10|     // ten i64 values
f64|..10|   // latest ten f64 values
i64..       // unbounded i64 sequence
i64...      // same as i64..
```

### 9.3 Type-Level Collection Sugar

Collection types are ordinary type-position forms:

```styio
__ : list[T] := T..
__ : string := char..
__ : dict[K, V] := (K, V)..
```

Examples:

```styio
@input : i64|10| := ...
@meta  : dict[string, string] := ...
@pairs : (string, string)|2| := ...
@price : f64|..10| := ...
@log   : string := ...
@logs  : list[string] := ...
```

`list[i64]|10|` is not the canonical spelling for ten integers; it normalizes to `i64|10|`. Prefer the direct length form.

### 9.4 Resource Flow and Copy

```styio
expr -> @price
@price >> #(x) => { ... }
snapshot << @price[...]
```

`->` writes a produced value into a resource sink. `>>` iterates the resource object. `<<` makes an explicit copy or snapshot.

Resource acquisition uses `<-` only at resource-entry boundaries:

```styio
l <- @stdin: list[i32]
l1 << l
```

Copying an already-bound resource as `l1 <- l` is rejected; use `l1 << l`.

### 9.5 Retired M6 State Containers

The old M6 surface used forms such as `@[...]` declarations and `$state`
shadow reads. Active code must use resource objects:

```styio
@ma5 : f64|..5|
get_ma(prices, 5) -> @ma5

@total_vol : f64|..1|
next_total = @total_vol[-1] + volumes
next_total -> @total_vol
```

The compiler rejects the old spelling with a migration diagnostic. Archived
milestone and ADR files may still mention it as provenance.

### 9.6 Retired History Probe: `[<<, n]`

The `$state[<<, n]` spelling belonged to the old M6 history-probe draft and is not active syntax.

---

## 10. Stream Synchronization

### 10.1 Aligned Sync (Zip): `&`

```
@binance >> #(p) & @okx >> #(p_okx) => {
    arbitrage_gap = p - p_okx
}
```

Both streams must deliver a pulse before the closure executes. The trigger frequency is `min(freq_A, freq_B)`.

Optional tolerance window:

```
@binance >> #(p) &[5ms] @okx >> #(p_okx) => { ... }
```

### 10.2 Snapshot Pull: `<< @resource`

```
@binance >> #(p) => {
    p_okx << @okx("BTC")
    gap = p - p_okx[-1]
}
```

The explicit `<<` copy makes the snapshot boundary visible. Older M6 examples used
snapshot declarations plus `$` shadow reads; new topology text should prefer
resource-object or snapshot-object reads such as `p_okx[-1]`.

Inline immediate pull (no state declaration, live read):

```
gap = p - (<- @okx("BTC"))
```

### 10.3 Synchronization Summary

| Mode | Syntax | Trigger | Use Case |
|------|--------|---------|----------|
| Zip | `A >> #(a) & B >> #(b)` | Both arrive | Atomic cross-exchange arbitrage |
| Snapshot | `v << @res` + `v[-1]` | Main flow only | Cross-frequency reference |
| Immediate Pull | `(<- @res)` | On-demand | One-shot live sampling |

---

## 11. Selector Operators: `[mode, arg]`

Square brackets serve as a **contextual transformer**, not just an indexer.

### 11.1 Static Indexing and Slicing

```
a[0]        // element at index 0
a[-1]       // last element / latest committed value
a[0..5]     // slice from 0 to 5
a[2..]      // slice from index 2 to end
a[..5]      // slice from start to index 5
a[..]       // all values
a[...]      // all values
```

Two or more dots are equivalent in selectors: `a[0..5]`, `a[0...5]`,
and `a[0.....5]` use the same range separator. A single dot remains
member access, as in `a.length`.

### 11.2 Retired Guard Selector: `[?, cond]`

The postfix guard selector was an early draft and is no longer active syntax.
Use `?(cond) => value | fallback` for value selection, or normal `?(cond) => { ... }`
blocks for statement-level control.

### 11.3 Retired Equality Probe: `[?=, val]`

The postfix equality probe was retired with the guard selector. Use `?=` match
blocks for equality-style branching.

### 11.4 Plugin Operators: `[op, n]`

```
prices[avg, 20]    // 20-period moving average (compiler intrinsic)
prices[max, 14]    // 14-period rolling maximum
prices[std, 20]    // 20-period standard deviation
```

These are **compiler intrinsics** — the compiler inlines optimized algorithms (O(1) sliding sum, monotonic queue, Welford's algorithm) directly into the generated code.

### 11.5 Retired History Probe: `[<<, n]`

The `$state[<<, n]` postfix history selector is not an active milestone syntax.
Future history access must re-enter with a revised selector or state-topology
fixture instead of reusing the old M6 spelling.

Historical examples remain provenance only in archived milestone docs.

---

## 12. I/O and Side Effects

### 12.1 Terminal Device: `>_`

`>_` is the **terminal device primitive** — a first-class resource handle representing the
user's terminal. Symbolic standard-stream definitions write it canonically as `[>_]`, with
`(>_)` retained as a compatibility spelling. All standard streams (`@stdout`, `@stderr`,
`@stdin`) are compiler-recognized resource atoms over this terminal device. See §8.7 for the
complete resource definitions and usage patterns.

**As a print statement (legacy, backward-compatible):**

```
>_("Hello, Styio!")
>_(variable)
```

`>_(expr)` remains functional for backward compatibility and is internally equivalent to
`expr -> ( >_ )`.

**As a value in expressions:**

```
42 -> @stdout                        // >_ used as redirect target under the hood
@stdin >> #(line) => { >_(line) }     // >_ used as stream source under the hood
```

**Type formatting rules** (applies to `>_()`, scalar `-> @stdout`, and iterable `>> @stdout` after serialization):

| Type | Output format |
|------|---------------|
| Integer | `%lld\n` |
| Float | `%.6f\n` |
| Bool | `true\n` / `false\n` |
| String | `%s\n` |
| Char | `%c\n` |
| `@` (Undefined) | `@\n` |

### 12.2 I/O Buffer: `>_` (stream context)

In stream contexts, `>_` writes to the system's buffered output channel.

### 12.3 Format Strings: `$`

```
$"Price is {p}, Volume is {v}" -> @stdout
```

### 12.4 Standard Error: `@stderr`

`@stderr` writes to Unix fd 2 with immediate flush. See §7.7 for definition.

```
"Error: file not found" -> @stderr
```

### 12.5 Standard Input: `@stdin`

`@stdin` is a line stream from Unix fd 0. See §7.7 for definition.

```
@stdin >> #(line) => {
  line -> @stdout
}
```

## 13. Error Handling Philosophy

### 13.1 Fail-Fast for Structural Errors

If a resource schema mismatch is detected (e.g., accessing a non-existent database column), the program terminates immediately at connection time — **before** the first data pulse. No silent degradation.

### 13.2 Algebraic Propagation for Data Errors

Missing data within a stream becomes runtime absence, displayed as `@` in diagnostics and terminal formatting. It propagates through supported downstream computations; user code should not manufacture this state with a standalone `@` literal.

### 13.3 Diagnostic Tracing

In debug mode, `@` values carry tainted metadata:

```
last_signal ?? reason    // "DataSource(@binance) timeout at 14:22:05.123"
```

The `??` operator extracts the diagnostic context from a tainted `@`.

### 13.4 Guard-based Recovery

```
safe_price = price | @last_valid_price[-1]    // fallback if price carries runtime absence
```

The `|` operator provides a fallback value when the left side carries runtime absence.

## 14. Compilation Modes

### 14.1 Development Mode (JIT)

- Full standard library loaded
- AI-assisted protocol probing enabled
- LLVM ORC JIT for instant execution
- Diagnostic tainting active

### 14.2 Strict Mode (AOT, `styio build --strict`)

- All types must be explicitly annotated
- All resource protocols must be specified
- Intent-aware dead code elimination
- Output: minimal native binary or WebAssembly module

### 14.3 Audit Mode (`styio audit --fix`)

- Scans retired state syntax as migration diagnostics and target `@name : Type` resources
- Generates explicit `schema` block at file header
- Reformats source according to Styio style guide

## Appendix A: Consultant's Additional Thoughts

### A.1 Reconciling Design with Existing Codebase

The current C++ compiler implementation already has a rich token system, parser, AST, IR, and LLVM codegen. However, significant features from the Gemini design discussion are not yet implemented:

- **Reserved wave tokens** (`<~`, `~>`) already exist at the lexer level but have no active grammar production
- **Target resource objects** (`@name : Type`, `@name[-1]`, `@name[...]`) require a new state/resource analysis pass
- **Pulse Frame Lock** needs runtime infrastructure in the JIT executor
- **Cross-stream sync** (`&`, `<< @res`) requires a concurrency model in the IR

**Recommended implementation order:**
1. Keep `?(cond) => value | fallback` and `?(cond) => { ... } | { ... }` as the active guard forms
2. Extend the parser/type system for `Type|n|`, `Type|..n|`, `Type..`, and `list[T]`
3. Add AST nodes for target resource declarations, resource selectors, and stream zip
4. Implement resource hoisting in the analyzer
5. Extend LLVM codegen for fixed-length and recent-window resource storage
6. Add concurrency primitives for stream synchronization

### A.2 Open Design Questions

1. **`>>` ambiguity resolution:** The parser must distinguish between pipe (`source >> consumer`), continue (`>>` as standalone statement), and stride selector (`[>>, 2]`). The current implementation already handles `>>` as `Iterate` — extending this to multi-meaning requires careful lookahead logic.

2. **`@` overload risk:** `@` remains overloaded as a resource prefix, state prefix, standard-stream prefix, and runtime absence marker. Source-level bare `@` has been retired from active syntax to reduce ambiguity.

3. **Legacy migration:** `@[n](var = expr)`, `@[var = init](expr)`, `$state`, and `$state[<<, n]` are retired parser errors. The active surface is `@name : Type|n|` / `@name : Type|..n|` plus resource-object selectors.

4. **Cross-platform builds:** The current CMakeLists.txt hardcodes Linux paths. Windows and macOS support need platform-conditional toolchain detection.

### A.3 Performance Considerations

The **Pulse Frame Lock** design is elegant but may introduce measurable overhead in ultra-high-frequency scenarios (>100k ticks/sec). Consider:
- A compile-time optimization that detects when frame lock is unnecessary (single resource-snapshot read, no aliasing)
- An `unsafe` annotation to opt out of frame lock for latency-critical inner loops
- Hardware-level atomic snapshot using `LOCK CMPXCHG` or ARM `LDXR/STXR` for multi-threaded shadow updates
